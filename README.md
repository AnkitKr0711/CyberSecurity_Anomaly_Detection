# CyberSecurity_Anomaly_Detection

Work In Progress.....

In Cyber security world any suspecious/anomalous activity in the Network may rescult into attack. Hence by studying such anomalous data points and shifts in the data distribution. We can design a model which can detect any suspicious movement in the newtork and raise red flag in time. thus avoiding the cost of critical system failure, or loss of severe Data, and longevity of deployed defensive systems.
I would like to know your opinion on how I can improve my future works. Enjoy reading! and Happy Learning!
